# AI-generated text detection ðŸ¤–
--------------------------------

**Instructor: Dr. Dave Wanik - University of Connecticut**

Can you predict the 'ind' (0 = human, 1 = AI) as a function of the 768 document embeddings, the word count and the punctuation? Be careful - there is imbalanced data which may require some advanced methods in order to get a reasonable model. Can you beat a naive (majority class) model or logistic regression? Now is your time to shine and apply everything you learned.
